Poe.house is a website that allows you to upload and share you hideout. More than 30 hideouts and 500 000 data base reads in the first 24h launch. Here are the features so far:

- Parses hideout file
- Generates shopping list
- Filter hideouts by master level
- Filter hideouts by if they have MTXs
- Filter hideouts by hideout type
- Description with markdown

For now I don't host anything so the hideout file needs to be on pastebin, images imgur direct link video is youtube. But it might be something I look into in the near future. Future features:

- Accounts to edit posts
- Place to submit your current decorations to generate appropriate shopping list
- Better design ( need you guys for this )
- ~~https~~
- ~~Internal database ( not firebase)~~
